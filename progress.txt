## Completed
### Iteration 1 — #72 Keyboard shortcuts: transport, navigation & editing
- `ProjectViewModel`: `selectedTrackID: ID<Track>?` for keyboard-driven track focus
- `ProjectViewModel`: `selectedContainerIDs: Set<ID<Container>>` for multi-select (Cmd+A)
- `selectAllContainers()` populates set with all container IDs in current song
- `deselectAll()` clears all selection state (container, track, section, multi-select)
- `selectTrackByIndex(_:)` sets selectedTrackID by 0-based index
- `lastBarWithContent` computed property: max endBar across containers and sections
- Transport shortcuts: Space (play/pause, already existed — verified), R (toggle record arm on selected track), M (toggle metronome)
- Navigation shortcuts: Left/Right arrows (nudge playhead ±1 bar), Home/Fn+Left (jump to bar 1), End/Fn+Right (jump to last bar with content), 1-9 (select track by index)
- Editing shortcuts: Cmd+D (duplicate selected container, or track if none), Cmd+A (select all containers), Escape (deselect all + clear range/track selection), Tab (cycle inspector mode)
- Existing shortcuts verified: Space (play/pause), Return (open detail editor), Delete (delete selected container/breakpoint), Cmd+C/V (copy/paste)
- Shortcuts fire via `.onKeyPress` on MainContentView; do not conflict with TextField focus
- 8 new tests: selectAllContainers, selectAllContainers empty, deselectAll, selectTrackByIndex, selectTrackByIndex out-of-range, lastBarWithContent, lastBarWithContent max of both, duplicate container undo/redo
- All 394 tests pass

### Iteration 2 — #73 Click-to-position: playhead positioning on ruler & timeline
- `TimelineViewModel`: `snappedBar(forXPosition:timeSignature:)` — snaps to bar at low zoom, to beat at high zoom (threshold: 40px per beat)
- `TransportViewModel`: `seek(toBar:)` — seeks playhead; if playing, stops/restarts PlaybackScheduler from new position
- `RulerView`: single click positions playhead (snapped), drag scrubs continuously, Shift+drag retains range selection behavior
- `RulerView`: `onPlayheadPosition` callback for playhead positioning
- `TimelineView`: click on empty grid area (no container hit) positions playhead via `onPlayheadPosition` callback
- `TimelineView`: `onTapGesture` on grid overlay with snapped bar conversion, does not interfere with container gestures
- `MainContentView`: wired both ruler and timeline `onPlayheadPosition` callbacks to `transportViewModel.seek(toBar:)`
- Pixel-to-bar snap logic: at low zoom (pixelsPerBeat < 40), rounds to nearest whole bar; at high zoom (pixelsPerBeat >= 40), rounds to nearest beat
- Seek during playback: pauses transport, stops scheduler, sets new position, re-prepares and replays from new bar
- Seek while stopped: directly sets playhead position
- 10 new tests: snappedBar at x=0, snappedBar at x=pixelsPerBar, snap-to-bar low zoom, snap-to-beat high zoom, various zoom levels, negative x clamping, 3/4 time signature, setPlayhead during playback, setPlayhead while stopped, setPlayhead fires callback
- All 404 tests pass

### Iteration 3 — #74 Time signature selector: UI control with grid/ruler/metronome update
- `ProjectViewModel`: `setTimeSignature(songID:beatsPerBar:beatUnit:)` with full undo/redo
- Validation: beatsPerBar 1–12, beatUnit in {2, 4, 8, 16}; rejects invalid values, no-op on same value
- `ToolbarView`: replaced display-only text with `Menu` picker showing 6 presets (2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/8, 7/8)
- `ToolbarView`: `onTimeSignatureChange` callback for decoupled communication
- `LoopsRootView`: wires toolbar callback to `ProjectViewModel.setTimeSignature`
- `LoopsRootView`: bidirectional sync — Song → TransportViewModel on song change, initial sync on appear
- Grid overlay (`GridOverlayView`) already reactive: uses `timeSignature.beatsPerBar` for beat subdivisions
- Ruler (`RulerView`) already reactive: uses `timeSignature.beatsPerBar` for beat ticks and snap logic
- Metronome already reactive: `MetronomeGenerator.update(bpm:beatsPerBar:sampleRate:)` called on play/seek with current time signature
- Changing time signature does NOT reposition existing containers (bars stay at same bar numbers)
- 8 new tests: setTimeSignature basic, undo/redo, invalid beatsPerBar (0/13/-1), invalid beatUnit (3/5/0), all valid beatUnits (2/4/8/16), beatsPerBar boundary values (1/12), no-op same value, containers not repositioned
- All 412 tests pass

- Automation lanes evaluated per-chunk during effect processing, targeting container's own AU parameters
- Instrument override AU loaded and used for containers that have one
- Bypassed effect chains render dry (effects skipped, matching real-time behavior)
- MIDI actions logged but not sent during offline render (no external hardware)
- Container trigger actions simulated: containers on muted tracks are included when triggered by audible containers
- Track-level effects processed via separate offline AVAudioEngine pass after container mixing
- `render()` method now `async` to support AU instantiation; ExportAudioView caller updated
- 6 new tests: enter fade gain ramp, exit fade gain ramp, bypassed chain renders dry, MIDI actions skipped, AU effect produces processed output (Apple Delay on impulse), trigger resolves container from muted track
- All 267 tests pass

# ============================================================

### Iteration 4 — #75 Master track: effects chain, output selector & metronome zones
- Added `.master` case to `TrackKind` enum with `creatableKinds` static property excluding master
- Created `MetronomeSettings` and `MetronomeSubdivision` models for per-section click behavior
- Added `metronomeSettings: MetronomeSettings?` to Container for master track metronome zones
- Added `isEffectChainBypassed: Bool` to Track for track-level effect chain bypass
- Added `masterTrack` computed property, `ensureMasterTrack()`, `ensureMasterTrackLast()` to Song
- Updated ProjectViewModel: auto-creates master track on new/open/add song, prevents master delete/duplicate/move, ensures master always last
- Added master track management methods: addMasterEffect, removeMasterEffect, toggleMasterEffectChainBypass, setMasterOutputPort
- Updated PlaybackScheduler: routes all track mixers through master mixer → master effects → main mixer
- Updated OfflineRenderer: 5-phase rendering (container → track effects → pre-master mix → master effects → write), excludes master from audible tracks, applies master volume/pan
- Updated TrackHeaderView: master-specific appearance (gray color, no record arm/monitor buttons, output routing display)
- Updated MainContentView: add track menu uses creatableKinds, context menu hides delete/duplicate/record for master, adds output selector for master
- Fixed exhaustive switch cases in TrackLaneView and StorylineInspectorView
- All backward-compatible: new fields use decodeIfPresent with defaults
- 13 files changed, 630 insertions
- 20 new tests (MetronomeSettings/Subdivision Codable, master track auto-creation, always-last ordering, delete/duplicate prevention, creatableKinds, ensureMasterTrack idempotency, legacy JSON decode)
- All 432 tests pass

### Iteration 5 — #76 Metronome enhancements: volume, output routing & subdivision
- `MetronomeGenerator`: added `volume` property (0.0–1.0, default 0.8), `setVolume(_:)` with clamping, `setSubdivision(_:)` for click density control
- `MetronomeGenerator`: subdivision-aware audio rendering — accent on beat 1 (1500 Hz), regular beats (1000 Hz), subdivision clicks (800 Hz, softer amplitude)
- `MetronomeGenerator`: `clicksPerBar(subdivision:beatsPerBar:)` static helper for timing calculations
- New `MetronomeConfig` model: `volume: Float`, `subdivision: MetronomeSubdivision`, `outputPortID: String?` — stored per song
- `Song` gains `metronomeConfig: MetronomeConfig` (default values, backward-compatible decoding)
- `AudioEngineManager`: dedicated `metronomeMixer` node for output routing, `setMetronomeOutputPort(_:)` method
- `TransportViewModel`: `metronomeVolume`, `metronomeSubdivision`, `metronomeOutputPortID` properties with setters
- `TransportViewModel`: `applyMetronomeConfig(_:)` for bulk config sync, `activeSubdivision(atBar:)` reads MetronomeSettings from active master track containers
- Play and seek paths now apply volume and subdivision to metronome before enabling
- `ProjectViewModel`: `setMetronomeConfig(songID:config:)` with full undo/redo, `duplicateSong` copies metronomeConfig
- `ToolbarView`: metronome volume slider (60px), subdivision picker menu (all 5 modes), output port selector submenu
- `LoopsRootView`: wired metronome config callbacks, bidirectional sync between Song and TransportViewModel
- 30 new tests: MetronomeGenerator volume/clamping/enabled/subdivision/clicksPerBar, MetronomeConfig Codable round-trip/defaults/volume clamping/no-output-port, Song with/without metronomeConfig, subdivision timing (clicks per bar for all modes in 4/4, 3/4, 6/8), ProjectViewModel setMetronomeConfig/undo-redo/no-op/duplicateSong
- All 462 tests pass
